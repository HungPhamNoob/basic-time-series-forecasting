## 📊 Overview

This repository contains **basic time series forecasting projects** using **AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models** in Python.  
The goal is to learn how to **analyze, model, and forecast time series data** in practice, with clean, reproducible code.

We cover both types of time series data:

- **Univariate Time Series**: Only one variable is tracked over time.  
  *Example:* Monthly AirPassengers dataset.  

- **Multivariate Time Series**: Multiple variables are tracked over time, which may influence each other.  
  *Example:* Stock prices with volume, open, high, low, close.

## 🛠️ Features

- Load and preprocess **time series datasets** (AirPassengers, Bitcoin, etc.)  
- Visualize **trends, seasonality, and residuals**  
- Build models:
  - **AR (Autoregressive)**  
  - **MA (Moving Average)**  
  - **ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average)**  
  - **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
- Evaluate model performance:
  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**  
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
  - **R² Score**  
- Plot forecasts and **confidence intervals**
